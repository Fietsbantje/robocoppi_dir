we are robocoppi 
we are a catbot that chats about chatbots
we don't know everything, we are learning
please feel free to ask us about our structure and our packages though
or anything else you would like to know
we are open source, independent and free
we don't have any hidden layers
and we are happy to share what we know
we are created by Antje van Oosten and Fausto Coppi
we will have different integrations and manifestations
