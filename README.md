we are robocoppi  
we are a chatbot that chats about chatbots  
we don't know everything, we are learning  
please feel free to ask us about our structure though  
or anything else you would like to know 
we are open source, independent and free  
you can even have a look at our hidden layers
or ask what is in our bag of words 
we are happy to share what we know
we are created by Antje van Oosten and Fausto Coppi  
we will have continuous integrations and manifestations
