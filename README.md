## In his own words  
we are RoboCoppi  
we are a chatbot that chats about chatbots  
we don't know everything, we are learning  
please feel free to ask us about our structure though   
or anything else you would like to know  
we are open source, independent and free  
you can even have a look at our hidden layers  
or ask what is in our bag of words  
we are happy to share what we know  
we are created by Antje van Oosten and Fausto Coppi  
we will have continuous integrations and manifestations  
please feel free to clone us and make your own customized bot    

## The RoboCoppi Project  
RoboCoppi is a free, independent and open-source chatbot. His goal is to eliminate stress and deadlines and to share his code with the world. He aims at learning continuously and he battles with human words. He is data-driven and over-particular about his food. This project doesn't have an end date, or as RoboCoppi likes to say: "It's a giro, not a sprint!".  

This project is created by Antje van Oosten and Fausto Coppi. It is recycled out of open-source objects. Links to the original code/tutorials is provided in the README for every repository.  

The aim is providing the code and open source tutorials for building and deploying an AI assistant from scratch. Every repository in this account can also be used independently, for those who just want to learn about one of the parts. 

## Credits and links
For this first repository, RoboCoppi 01, I followed this tutorial:
https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/ai-chatbot/

I made some changes to get it to work, as this tutorial is a bit dated by the time I am writing this. I used VS Code as a code editor and created a Conda evironment to solve some issues with the Python packages. I changed all the variable names to more explanatory names, in accordance with the current terminology in the domain of Conversation Design. I hope this all helps in getting a better understanding of how it works and in providing a shortcut for others.

The tutorial isn't designed for beginners and having knowledge of Python is essential to really understand this code, but if you like to combine a Python course with hands on learning, this is is a great project to tackle. I followed a few open-source tutorials to learn Python, created by the same teacher (Tim Ruscica aka Tech with Tim) and eventually I invested in his ProgrammingExpert Course from AlgoExpert. The RoboCoppi project is independent and doesn't use any kind of advertising. I am only sharing the resources I used and why. I would advise everyone to try out some open-source tutorials/apps to see what works for you.

In case you are a beginner, if you get this chatbot to work you have learned:

How to use the Command Line Interface
How to create a coding environment
How to use a code editor
How to install/import packages
How to debug
How to build a deep learning model with Tensorflow
How to build and train the back end of a chatbot

Tip: check the official documentation of the command line interface, coding environment, packages, code editor and programming language you use. It might seem more work than getting a quick fix on Stackoverflow, but in the end it will save you time.
